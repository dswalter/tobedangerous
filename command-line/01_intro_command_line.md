The UNIX command line is still worth learning, even in 2016, because it allows you to flexibly automate parts of your workflow you might not have otherwise considered doing. For example, if you've ever moved files on your computer using a drag and drop interface, you probably got frustrated when trying to move all the pictures in a folder to somewhere else. Using the command line tool *mv*, you can move all the .jpg files from one file to another in one command:
    mv original_directory/*.jpg new_directory/

That's it. 



The basic idea behind the unix philosophy is to do one thing, and to do it well. It's a seductive philosophy, for reasons we will get into later.
