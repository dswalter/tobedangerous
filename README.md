To be an effective data scientist requires a relatively clear understanding of a dizzying number of topics. This repo is designed to help ease that transition. It's not a full curriculum, hence the name. You won't know enough about data science to be great at it, just "enough to be dangerous."

I've tried to vary the content based on what would be most helpful. It makes sense to present basic machine learning concepts in a Jupyter notebook, and so we'll use that. A discussion that doesn't require code might work better as a pure markdown post, then.

We'll see how this evolves. If you haven't had much experience with programming before, I'd recommend starting with "basics of computing." It's amazing how much benefit you can get from a little history and philosophy of computing.
